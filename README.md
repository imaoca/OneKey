# OneKey
I would like to show you a new concept keyboard.  
That is use CW code. So only one key but express alphabetic and numeric.　　  
You can use it as a USB HID class by using Arduino Leopardo.
The horizontal axis is the popsicle stick.
The knob is a plastic bottle cap.
And the fulcrum of the horizontal axis is the eraser.
Anyone can create it right away.
Please enjoy the new concept keyboard.
